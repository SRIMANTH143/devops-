Jenkins
+++++++++++++
Jenkins is a  CI server which manages and control process such as 
Plan, Code, Build test, deploy operates and monitor in DevOps Env.

Jenkins:
+++++
3 Pre-Requists
1. Java - 1.8 version
2. Git
3. Maven - Build Tool ( Ant, Gradle)
#(root directory)

8080 - default

what is jenkins job?
====================
A Jenkins job is a sequential set of tasks that a user defines. 
For example, a job can fetch source code from version control, compile the code, run unit tests, and more. Note that in Jenkins, the term “job” is synonymous with “project”

2 Types:
1. Freestyle job - Manual - UI
2. Pipeline - Groovy Scripting - CI/CD

what is Freestle Job?
================
This is the central feature of Jenkins. 
Jenkins will build your project, combining any SCM with any build system, and this can be even used for something other than software build.

what is pipeline?
================
Orchestrates long-running activities that can span multiple build agents. 
Suitable for building pipelines (formerly known as workflows) and/or organizing complex activities that do not easily fit in free-style job type.

Jobs Creation:

Build Tool of Maven
=================

1. compile :
===========
   convert into machine understandable language
2. Code Reviiew
================
    reporting task, code analysis report - PMD Tool
3. Unit Test
============
   execution of test cases, test report( pass or fail)
4. Code Coverage
===========
 % code covered by the test executes, coverage report
5. Package
 ==============
its convert into .jar, .war, .ear

Build Life Cycle
=================
validate - validate the project is correct and all necessary information is available
compile - compile the source code of the project
test - test the compiled source code using a suitable unit testing framework. These tests should not require the code be packaged or deployed
package - take the compiled code and package it in its distributable format, such as a JAR.
verify - run any checks on results of integration tests to ensure quality criteria are met
install - install the package into the local repository, for use as a dependency in other projects locally
deploy - done in the build environment, copies the final package to the remote repository for sharing with other developers and projects.

why Jenkins is so popular
==========================
open source
Good Plugin support
Good community support
Fast and reliable
Good OS Support
Scripted Build

Features of Jenkins
===============
Easy installation process
provides advance security
upgrades are easily available
light weight container support
Distributed Team Management

Master & Slave configuration:
++++++++++++++++++

Jenkins Master:

1.Jenkins Master perform basic installtion and handles task related to build and configuration.

2.schedule builds
3.they moniter slaves
4.records and presents the build resulits

Jenkins Slave:
___________-
1. Slaves are basically setup to offload builds from the master and disturbute the work loads
2. They listen to the master request
3. Slaves can run on variety of OS.(Linux & windows)
4. They minely execute bild jobs which are dispached by jenkins master instance jobs

Jenkins:
CI


scm:
git, svn, cvs,TFS 

SVN - Plugin needs to be in the jenkins


Master and Slave Configuration:
___________________________



Jenkins Pipeline :
2 type of pipeline jobs
1. Scripted pipeline - node (old )
2. Declarative Pipeline - 
Groovy script we are using declarative pipilene 
2 ways
- pipeline script - Groovy script
- Snippest generator - jenkins jobs dash board

5 Stages:
++++++++++
1. Continous Downloading(github)
2. Continuous Build
3. Continuous Deployment- automatic/manual deployment
4. Continuous Test - test
5. Continuous Delivery - ( final production delivery)


Groovy Scripting:
+++++++++++++
1. Pipeline{
    agent none 
       stages{
          stage('Checkout from git'){
           agent any
           stpes{
           sh 'https://github.com/SobhaReddy/myE2e05Aug.git'
          }
         }
